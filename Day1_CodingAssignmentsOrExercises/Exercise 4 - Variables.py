Instructions

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18.

Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

Example Input
a: 3
b: 5

Example Output
a: 5
b: 3

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:
