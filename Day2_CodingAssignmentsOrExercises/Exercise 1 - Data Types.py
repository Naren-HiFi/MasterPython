"""
Instructions

Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number.

e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs.
 e.g. any two-digit number.

Example Input
39

Example Output
3 + 9 = 12
12

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:



Hint

Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.

Think about what you learnt about subscripting.

Think about type conversion.
