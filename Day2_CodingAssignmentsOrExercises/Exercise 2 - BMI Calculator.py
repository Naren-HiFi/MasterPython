#        Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

#        The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height.
#         e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the
#                    short person is usually more overweight.

#           The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square
#           of their height (in m):

#            BMI = weight (kg) / height ** 2 ( m ** 2)


# Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

#        Example Input
#         weight = 80
#         height = 1.75

#        Example Output
#        80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
#        26
