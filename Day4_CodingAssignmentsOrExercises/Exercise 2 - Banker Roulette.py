You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names.

The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names.

For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space.

 e.g. name, name, name

Example Input

Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe

Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

Example Output

Michael is going to buy the meal today!

Hint

You might need the help of the len() function.

Remember that Lists start at index 0!

import random

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")

#Write your code below this line 👇

#Get the total number of items in list.
num_items = len(names)

#Generate random numbers between 0 and the last index.
random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1)

#Pick out random person from list of names using the random number.
person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice]

print(person_who_will_pay + " is going to buy the meal today!")


# Alternative way to generate random number using random.choice() function

random_name = random.choice(names)
print(f"{random_name} is going to buy the meal today")
