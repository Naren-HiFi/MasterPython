def foo(a, b=4, c=6):
    print(a, b, c)
foo(20, c=12)

'''
The output of the code will be: 20 4 12

Explanation:

The code defines a function foo() that takes three parameters: a, b, and c.

The b and c parameters have default values of 4 and 6, respectively.

When foo(20, c=12) is called, the value 20 is assigned to the a parameter, and the value 12 
is assigned to the c parameter, while the b parameter takes its default value of 4.

When the print() function is called inside foo(), it prints the values of a, b, and c, which are 20, 4, and 12,
respectively.

Therefore, the output of the code will be: 20 4 12
