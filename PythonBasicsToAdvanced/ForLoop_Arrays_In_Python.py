numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
result = [num + 3 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(result)

"""

The output of the code will be: [5, 11, 37]

Explanation:

The code defines a list of numbers.

The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list called result.

The list comprehension iterates over numbers and selects only the even numbers using the
condition if num % 2 == 0.

For each even number in numbers, the list comprehension adds 3 to it and appends the result to result.

Therefore, the resulting list result contains the values [4+3, 8+3, 34+3, 52+3], which are
equal to [7, 11, 37, 59].

When the print() function is called with result as its argument, it outputs [5, 11, 37, 59]. 

This is because the list comprehension is adding 3 to each even number in the original numbers list, not to
each even number in the resulting result list. 

The first even number in numbers is 2, which when added to 3 results in 5.
