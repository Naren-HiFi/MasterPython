The output of the given code will be "B".

Explanation:

The code checks the value of the variable score and assigns a grade based on certain conditions.

The first if statement checks if score is less than 80 and greater than 70.

However, this condition is not met because score is 67, which is less than 80 but not greater than 70.

So, this block is skipped.

The second elif statement checks if score is less than 90 or greater than 80.

Since score is less than 90 but greater than 80, this condition is met and the code prints "B".

The remaining conditions are not checked because the second elif statement is true and
its block of code is executed.
