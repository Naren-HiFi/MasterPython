"""

Get the user input in the console using input() function and assign it to a variable
 
Assign the length of the user input to the variable length
 
Print the length in the console using print() function
 
name of the variable has to be one single unit. 
 
In order to separate words in python, you need to use underscore
 
If you want to use numbers in the name of the variable, you can for example len1 = 10

But the numbers can't be at the beginning of the variable name, that will generate syntax error

Don't use special function names because it creates the confusion

For example: input = input("Name")

You can get the name error when you run the below code.

name = "Jack"
print(nama)

You can get the invalid syntax error when you run the below code.

user name = input("what is your name?")


Give meaningful names to the variables

"""

userInput = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(userInput)
print(length)
