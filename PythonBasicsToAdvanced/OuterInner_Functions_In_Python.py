The output of the given code will be 15.

Explanation:

The code defines a function outer_function() that takes two parameters a and b.

Inside outer_function(), another function inner_function() is defined that takes two parameters c and d and
returns their sum.

outer_function() calls inner_function() with the values of a and b as arguments, and returns the result 
of this call.

When outer_function(5, 10) is called, it passes 5 and 10 as the arguments to inner_function(), which 
returns their sum 15.

This sum is then returned by outer_function() and assigned to the variable result.

Finally, the print() function is called with result as the argument, which prints the value 15.
