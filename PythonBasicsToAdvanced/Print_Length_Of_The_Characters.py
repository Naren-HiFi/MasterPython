The output of the Python code

print(len("95637+12")) will be 8.

Explanation:

The function len() in Python is used to get the length of a string,
which means the number of characters in the string.
In this case, the string is "95637+12", which has 8 characters (5 digits, 1 plus sign, and 2 more digits).
So, when we call len("95637+12"), it returns the value 8, which is then printed by the print() function.
